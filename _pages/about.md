I'm a recent graduate in Computer Engineering B.Sc. from University of Isfahan. Throoughout my undergraduate studies I worked on topics in Statistical Inference and Generative Modeling. Furthermore, I have worked on various project in Machine Learning e.g., Computer Vision, Graph Neural Networks and Natural Language processing.

I focus on Pure Mathematics and how it can inspire novel ideas in Machine Learning. For example, the Stochastic Calculus take on Diffusion Models, Homeomorphism Interpolation done by Neural ODEs or relation of Normalaizing FLows to Differential Equations are a small number of these ideas. Besides these inspirations, I want to dive deeper in more abstract ideas from Pure Mathematics in my following endeavours.
